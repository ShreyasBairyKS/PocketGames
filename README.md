Design and implement a mini-project to create a suite of classic “POCKET GAMES” including Hand Cricket, Rock Paper Scissors, and Hangman. Each game should have its own set of rules, user interface, and gameplay mechanics. The objective is to provide an interactive and enjoyable experience for users while demonstrating proficiency in programming concepts such as conditional statements, loops, user input/output, and basic data structures
